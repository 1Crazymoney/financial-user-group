## Mission statement (Jonathan)

“The primary aim of this group is to foster interest and engagement from the finance industry to address security, regulatory and compliance related issues when using cloud native platforms.  This would include the preparation of agreed best practices for the use of cloud native technologies in a regulated financial services context including interaction with common regulators and auditors”

## Open source useful code / programme (Jonathan)
* Threat model / initial configuration  (Open source TBC ~June)
* Kubernetes security training system (Open source end of June, can informally demonstrate at Kubecon EMEA)
* Gauge interest in parties willing to contribute to this

## Suggested near term goals (Jonathan)
* Discuss threat model, create base set of controls that meet regulatory requirements (PCI, DSS, etc.)
* Automated test suite to show conformance – spec + OSS tool (CIS Benchmarks)
* Discuss experiences of using Kubernetes / challenges in banking (open)

## Logistics (Cheryl)
* Future calls monthly at this time (4th Tuesday of each month at 3pm UTC)
* Informal face to face meeting at KubeCon EU in Barcelona (Tuesday, May 21 at 3:55pm)
* Mailing list to be set up
* Github repo / vendors? - closed to vendors currently but can invite TOC / SIG leads / vendors as necessary

## Mission statement (Jonathan)

#### JM: Presented draft mission statement for comment

“The primary aim of this group is to foster interest and engagement from the finance industry to address security, regulatory and compliance related issues when using cloud native platforms.  This would include the preparation of agreed best practices for the use of cloud native technologies in a regulated financial services context including interaction with common regulators and auditors”



#### JM: Highlighted two key areas of interest from my perspective then opened conversation to other suggested goals / focus areas.  I have listed the topics raised including the attendees interest from the session, please correct and update as appropriate.

1) Codifying compliance controls with automated tests (JPMC, Capital One) - Need best practices, codified control implementation and automated test suite to validate the efficacy of regulatory / compliance controls, such as SOC1, PCI, etc..  JPMC aiming to open source material, code and test cases in collaboration with others, pending appropriate internal discussion around sensitivity and logistics.  A request was raised by another participant to include potential regional differences.  

2) Kubernetes Security Training (JPMC, Deutsche, Capital One) - JPMC working to open source approach by the end of June with an initial review available for Kubecon.  I am looking for contributors to create exercises if of interest.  Additionally having the ability to detect via logging / telemetry security issues in a way that would be easy to notify the SOC.  Potentially through normalisation of log data format and associated queries.

3) SDLC (Capital One, Morgan Stanley, JPMC) - Best practices from container scanning, signing.  One participant highlighted significant Artefactory bloat, inability to efficiently scan.

4) Multi-tenancy (JPMC, Nomura, Capital One) - Best practices and design patterns required for isolation, scalability 

5) Container readiness (Capital One) - @Jimmy Ray, you had a number of detailed points here

6) How to move old applications into containers (JPMC, Capital One, HSBC, Nomura) - Requiring single tenant, traditional application hosting.

7) Multi-cloud best practices (Capital One) - Best practices to show how to operate efficiently in a multi-cloud environment 


## Open source useful code / programme (Jonathan)
* Threat model / initial configuration  (Open source TBC ~June)
    * Discussed as above, JPMC & Capital One raised interest thus far
* Kubernetes security training system (Open source end of June, can informally demonstrate at Kubecon EMEA)
    * Discussed as above, JPMC, Deutsche and Capital One raised interest thus far
* Gauge interest in parties willing to contribute to this


## Suggested near term goals (Jonathan)

#### JM: Although I have interest in the majority of points raised during the meeting I am personally going to focus on the 1 & 2.  I would also like to contribute with other parties on point 3 above.

1. Codified compliance controlers
    * JM: Discuss internally to seek guidance on amount of existing content able to discuss externally
    * JM: Reach out to interested parties to further this conversation with view to setting scope and discussing design for automated, codified solution.
2. Kubernetes Security Training
    * JM: Aim to provide brief demo in time for Kubecon
    * JM: Would be interested in discussing this further with any interested parties ahead of Kubecon

## Logistics (Cheryl)
* Future calls monthly at this time (4th Tuesday of each month at 3pm UTC)
* Informal face to face meeting at KubeCon EU in Barcelona (Tuesday, May 21 at 3:55pm)
* Mailing list to be set up
* Github repo / vendors? - closed to vendors currently but can invite TOC / SIG leads / vendors as necessary
