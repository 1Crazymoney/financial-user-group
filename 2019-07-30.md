# Meeting notes from July 30th.

The co-chairs of the FSUG agreed and proposed the following areas of focus to the group. 

**Short Term** 
 - Ask for volunteers to present their Kubernetes Journey so the group can learn for those experiences. 

**Longer Term** 
- Create a set of security controls that meet the needs of the security industry for different areas such as Kubernetes, CI/CD, etc.. Everyone should be able to contribute to this. 

The group will be asked to submit the different focus areas ( CI/CD, Runtime, Network Security, etc.. ), Volunteers will asked to lead groups and group members are asked to be part of one or more groups. The groups ( interest groups ? ) will be asked to present their progress to the larger group.
