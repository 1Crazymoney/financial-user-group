## PROJECT BRIEF - Kubernetes Security Training System

### Description: 
This solution aims to provide users with a hands on approach to Kubernetes security training.  The system will provide a segregated training environment and the ability to select a training exercises to be loaded.  The exercise will require the user to either mitigate a potential threat in the cluster or attack a cluster with the aim of gaining access to a specified flag.

For each exercise the user will receive a short brief detailing the expected target.  Hints will also be available in case the user requires additional information.  

A validate button will be provided, allowing the user to enter a specified flag or check that a specific attack vector has been disabled.  At a later stage a scoring scheme will be in place, each time a hint is used the maximum score would be reduced.

A subsequent phase would allow multi-part exercises whereby a user would attempt to mitigate a vulnerability first, then save the state of the cluster for a second user to attempt to exploit the cluster.

### Next Steps:
* Phase 1 (end of June) - System will be deployed into a cloud environment.  Exercise can be chosen from selection of 5 exercises 
* Phase 2 (end of July) - Additional 20 exercises
